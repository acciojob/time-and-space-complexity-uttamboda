	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of the input. An algorithm with lower time complexity is generally considered more efficient, as it can handle larger inputs in less time. Understanding time complexity is crucial for optimizing algorithms and improving the performance of software applications.</p>
    
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory or space an algorithm uses as a function of the size of the input. In many cases, the space complexity of an algorithm is described using Big-O notation, such as O(n), where n is the size of the input. A space complexity of O(n) means that the memory required grows linearly with the size of the input.</p>
